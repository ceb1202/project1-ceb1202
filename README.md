**Project 1: Input-Compute-Output Programming Pattern**

These guidelines are also in Canvas, **Assignments --> Project 1
Input-Compute-Output** page.

The purpose of the project is to think about and apply a problem-solving
strategy or programming pattern called ***input-compute-output.***

In Runestone textbook, go to the **Project List,** select project
**#3**, titled ***How Many Handshakes?***

**Step 1**: Read about the **Input-Compute-Output** problem solving pattern.\
**Step 2:** Examine the example in Active Code **Activity 1**\
**Step 3:** Save & Run.\
**Step 4:** Use CodeLens to see the program\'s execution.

In this project you will write the design and implementation that
address the following **three questions**

**Q1:** Change the problem above to print the number of seconds\
**Q2:** Change the problem above to go the other direction, given a
number of seconds, how many years?\
**Q3:** Enhance solution to Q1 above so that you print the number of
years, months, days and minutes.

NOTE that ***How Many Trees*** and ***How Many Handshakes*** [are NOT
required]{.underline} for this project.

## Specifications

### Documentation

The module **input_compute_output.py** has the following **docstring**
at the beginning of the file. It has some information about the module,
such as name of the module, contributors, and date.

-   A **docstring** is a multi-line comment in Python enclosed in triple
    double quotes, e.g. **\"\"\"**
-   It allows us to embed documentation about the module:

```
File: project1/input_compute_output.py
Initial developers: Professors Gitlitz and Sabin
Student developers:
Date:
```
-   Update the module **docstring** with information about your name and
    your partner\'s name (in the Student developers field), and date of
    today, when you start working on it.

### The Design

Before we write code, we make sense of how to solve the problem. That\'s
why we write down the algorithmic steps. Think of these steps as
something we can explain to someone to convince them about our
problem-solving approach.

The design descriptions are NOT Python statements. However, they use
high-level level computational concepts, such as **data type,
variable,** **assignment**, **loop**, **conditional**, **calling
built-in** functions, **data type operations,** and **methods**. These
computational steps will guide you write the code.

### Incremental Development

For this project, we apply incremental development to answer ALL the
questions, including the intial question. For each question we do the
following:

1.  Write the design descriptions in **DESIGN.md**
2.  Write the code in **input_compute_output.py**
3.  Test the code by running the program in the VS Code terminal.
4.  Check for errors reported in the **Problems** tab, understand and
    fix them.

Install useful VS Code extensions that help you with fixing styling and
syntax errors: **black formatter** and **pylance** extensions.

## Submission

### Upload project files to GitHub

Upload **input_compute_output.py** and **DESIGN.md** to the **remote
repository** **project1-xxx** in GitHub, where **xxx** is your GitHub
username.

-   Click on the remote repo link \[...\] to see your **project1-xxx**
    remote repository.
-   Use the **Add file -\>Upload** and choose your local **project1**
    files:
    -   **input_compute_output.py** and **DESIGN.md** for uploading.

### Upload the design to Canvas

-   Convert DESIGN.md to PDF using using VS Code extension to convert MD
    to PDF.
-   Upload the PDF version to Canvas using the **project1** submission
    link.

## Evaluation

-   Design: 60%, 20% for each question
-   Implementation: 30% (10% for each of the 3 questions)
-   Code Styling: 10%
